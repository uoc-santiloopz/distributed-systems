# Coordination and Agreement


`Distributed processes` often need to coordinate their activities. If a collection of processes share a resource or collection of resources, then often `mutual exclusion` is required to prevent interference and ensure consistency when accessing the resources. This is the `critical section` problem, familiar in the domain of `operating systems`. In a `distributed system`, however, neither shared variables nor facilities supplied by a single local kernel can be used to solve it, in general. We require a solution to distributed mutual exclusion: one that is based solely on message passing.  
The simplest way to achieve **mutual exclusion** is to employ a server that grants permission to enter the critical section. To enter a **critical section**, a process sends a **request message** to the **server** and awaits a reply from it. Conceptually, the reply constitutes a `token` signifying permission to enter the critical section. If no other process has the `token` at the time of the request, then the server replies immediately, granting the token. If the token is currently held by another process, then the server does not reply, but **queues the request**. When a process exits the critical section, it sends a message to the server, giving it back the token.
