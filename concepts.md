# Concepts


* `backbone`: a network link with a high transmission capacity, employing satellite connections, fibre optic cables and other high-bandwidth circuits.

* `Ubiquitous computing`: the harnessing of many small, cheap computational devices that are present in users’ physical environments, including the home, office and even natural settings. The term ‘ubiquitous’ is intended to suggest that small computing devices will eventually become so pervasive in everyday objects that they are scarcely noticed.

* `cloud computing`: used to capture this vision of computing as a utility. A cloud is defined as a set of Internet-based application, storage and computing services sufficient to support most users’ needs, thus enabling them to largely or totally dispense with local data storage and application software. The term also promotes a view of everything as a service, from physical or virtual infrastructure through to software, often paid for on a per-usage basis rather than purchased. Note that cloud computing reduces requirements on users’ devices.
